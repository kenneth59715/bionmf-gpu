To build and run:

- git clone the bionmf-gpu repo

- create a working directory to serve a the top level of the jobs.

- from the repo, cp test/ALL_AML_data.gct to the working directory.

- reference makeit.template to create a script to run make in the
  bionmf-gpu repo.  Set BIONMFGPUPATH to the path to the repo.
  This will generate a bunch of warnings, but should also create
  bin/NMF_mGPU in the repo

- reference testjob.template to create an LSF job script.  Set these:
export WORKINGDIR=<path to desired working directory>
export BIONMFGPUPATH=<path to bionmf-gpu repo>
export CONSENSUSPY=<path to consensus.py>
export PYVENVPATH=<path to python venv>

- submit the job with bsub.  The job should create a jobdir.$JOB_ID
  directory under the working directory.  The consensus matrix should
  get printed in stdout.

scipy needed for numpy, no binary package for power9.
