 * common.h
 *	Some generic definitions, constants, macros and functions used by NMF-mGPU.
 *
 * NOTE: The following macro constants can be defined to modify the
 *	behavior of routines, as well as some constant and data-type definitions.
 *
 *	Additional information:
 *		NMFGPU_VERBOSE_2: Shows the parameters in some routine calls.
 *
 *	Debug / Testing:
 *		NMFGPU_FIXED_INIT: Uses "random" values generated from the fixed seed: FIXED_SEED.
 *
 **********************************************************
 **********************************************************
 **********************************************************
 *
 * Data matrices:
 *	V (N rows, M columns): input matrix
 *	W (N,K): output matrix
 *	H (K,M): output matrix,
 * such that: V  ~  W * H.
 *
 * Arguments:
 *	Matrix V (and its dimensions)
 *	K: Factorization Rank
 *
 *
 * NOTE: In order to improve performance:
 *
 *	+ Matrix H is stored in memory as COLUMN-major (i.e., it is transposed).
 *
 *	+ All matrices include useless data for padding. Padded dimensions
 *	  are denoted with the 'p' character. For instance:
 *		Mp, which is equal to <M + padding>
 *		Kp, which is equal to <K + padding>.
 *
 *	  Data alignment is controlled by the global variable: memory_alignment.
 *
 *	  This leads to the following limits:
 *		- Maximum number of columns (padded or not): matrix_max_pitch.
 *		- Maximum number of rows: matrix_max_non_padded_dim.
 *		- Maximum number of items: matrix_max_num_items.
 *
 *	  All four GLOBAL variables must be initialized with the set_matrix_limits()
 *	  function.
 *
 ****************
 *
 * Matrix tags:
 *
 * Any matrix may include the following "tag" elements:
 *
 *	+ A short description string, referred as "name".
 *	+ A list of column headers.
 *	+ A list of row labels.
 *
 * Each list is stored in a "struct tag_t" structure, which is composed by:
 *	+ All tokens stored as a (large) single string.
 *	+ An array of pointers to such tokens.
 *
 * All three elements (the "name" string, and the two tag_t structures) are
 * then stored in a "struct matrix_tags_t" structure.
 *
 * Both types of structure are defined in "matrix_io_routines.h".
 *
 ****************
 *
 * Multi-GPU version:
 *
 * When the input matrix V is distributed among multiple devices each host thread processes
 * the following sets of rows and columns:
 *
 *	Vrow[ 1..NpP ][ 1..M ] <-- V[ bN..(bN+NpP) ][ 1..M ]	(i.e., NpP rows, starting from bN)
 *	Vcol[ 1..N ][ 1..MpP ] <-- V[ 1..N ][ bM..(bM+MpP) ]	(i.e., MpP columns, starting from bM)
 *
 * Such sets allow to update the corresponding rows and columns of W and H, respectively.
 *
 * Note that each host thread has a private full copy of matrices W and H, which must be synchronized
 * after being updated.
 *
 ****************
 *
 * Large input matrix (blockwise processing):
 *
 * If the input matrix (or the portion assigned to this device) is too large for the GPU memory,
 * it must be blockwise processed as follow:
 *
 *	d_Vrow[1..BLN][1..Mp] <-- Vrow[ offset..(offset + BLN) ][1..Mp]			(i.e., BLN <= NpP rows)
 *	d_Vcol[1..N][1..BLMp] <-- Vcol[1..N][ offset_Vcol..(offset_Vcol + BLMp) ]	(i.e., BLM <= MpP columns)
 *
 * Note that padded dimensions are denoted with the suffix 'p' (e.g., Mp, BLMp, etc).
 *
 * In any case, matrices W and H are fully loaded into the GPU memory.
 *
 * Information for blockwise processing is stored in two block_t structures (one for each dimension).
 * Such structures ('block_N' and 'block_M') are initialized in the init_block_conf() routine.
 *
 ****************
 *
 * Mapped Memory on integrated GPUs:
 *
 * On integrated systems, such as notebooks, where device memory and host memory are physically the
 * same (but disjoint regions), any data transfer between host and device memory is superfluous.
 * In such case, host memory is mapped into the address space of the device, and all transfer
 * operations are skipped. Memory for temporary buffers (e.g., d_WH or d_Aux) is also allocated
 * on the HOST and then mapped. This saves device memory, which is typically required for graphics/video
 * operations.
 *
 * This feature is disabled if NMFGPU_FORCE_BLOCKS is non-zero.
